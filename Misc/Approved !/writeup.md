### Solution :

So the time mentioned was a deviation, it didn't direct to anything and neither you had to fill what and where.

You had to think simply, i hope most of you had got the answer of (approved of where) - CTFTIME, which was also in bold Letters, `TIME` and `CTF`.

Now the other question was (approved of what) - `GREP CTF`.

So, now if you just go to CTFTIME and find `GREPCTF`, you will see this :

Click on GREPCTF, and you will find a hex code which translates to flag :

Flag - GREP{W3lc0me_t0_GR3P_CTF}

PS. didn't intend to make it hard !! Sorry
