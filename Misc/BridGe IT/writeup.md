### Solution 

The name hints abt briding things and there is also a hint abt 3 parts in flag. There was a hint in challenge name Brid`G`e `IT` i.e GIT.
There are some words in Caps that are genuine direct hints for you to solve !! Generally, in OSINT challenges, even this much isn't provided and you've to work out your way yourself which makes it further more difficult.

But for this one, everything is listed : Words in CAPS --> `T` `BIT` `P` `DISC0RD` `HUB` `IG` `G2` `CAS` `LINKEDIN` 

Now, there are a lot of hints already with you, BIT P hints towards BIT Planes, so there is another image hidden in BIT Plane :
My two favourite tools : [stegonline](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload) and [aperisolve.fr](https://aperisolve.fr/),

You will get the first lead in question :

`G2` was a hint of BIT PLANE i.e Green 2 bit plane. 

Now, moving on to `DISC0RD` hint, you'll find the third part of flag in my bio itself, cakewalk !!

Now, my GitHub link is already provided !! Just visit there and check my latest commits !! Also mentioned in bio `Comitted...`

Now, you'll find the second hint :

Even LinkenIn word is mentioned which made this even more easiers, <Firstname> + " " + <codename> translates to `Chaitanya ckc`.
  
Now find my other account on linkedIn,

So, you get the second part as well and that leaves only the third part which is on `IG` as mentioned in hints too. `IG` is short for `Instagram`. Virat photo confirms
that you are on the right track !!

Covid batch is also mentioned, so you just had to visit the insta page of vkc1404 (ckc1404 replace vk first few letters) and there is the third
