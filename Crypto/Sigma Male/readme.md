### Sigma male 

> DESCRIPTION - 
I was doing the course of M3, mathematics but was really difficult. Got a C in it and eventually I became a Sigma male ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿. Now, I just play CTF all day and read Wr1teups ðŸ—¿. Some challenges are pretty interesting. Once I finished 8th in a ctf, FTW !! Sigma male is better less goo !! Say with me SIGMALEFTW !!

### Solution

This challenge was released later and hence, less solves. Otherwise, once you figure out the cipher. It was just an easy one and you had to play around with keys position and rings of enigma cipher.

So the word Sigma hinted towards enigma cipher (Same sound) and there are 5 sigmas of progress by Alan turing, the person who cracked Enigma code.

Now, just go to [crypti.com](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine) or search on google enigma decoder and then go to `crypti.com` and provide the correct keys and plugboard to get the flag.

- Sigma male song lyrics > first para (useless), second para is your flag !!

CTF and FTW were in caps hinting towards the position and rings. `got 8th in a ctf` - hint for position and the third rotor to be 8. First and second rotor are the number of emojis `4` and `1`. so the rotors are `418`, positions are `CTF`. Now if u figure out `CTF` as pos, then only the rings are left which can be replaced by `FTW`.

`si gm al ef tw` is the plugboard and we have to include foreign chars to view the flag.

Flag : GREP{lessgo_enigma}
