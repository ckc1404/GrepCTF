# Infinite sleep
>> quasar-nova 

## Description
I found a weird way to compile a python program into a binary and made it to sleep for minimum 2 days (using the libc `sleep` function) repeatedly. And I made the program to print the flag variable after that.
Now, it is your task to figure out how can you leak the flag within the challenge time.

## Requirements
+ Python 3.10
+ All `*.so.*` the libraries in the same directory
