# Infinite sleep
> quasar-nova 

## Description
I found a weird way to compile a python program into a binary and made it to sleep for minimum 2 days (using the libc `sleep` function) repeatedly. After that, I made the program to print the flag variable.
Now, it is your task to figure out how can you leak the flag within the challenge time.

## Requirements
+ Python 3

## Todo
+ Check with other versions of python (python 3.10 and python 3.11)

## Hints
A lot of game mods (including mods for popular games like GTA SA) work the same way
