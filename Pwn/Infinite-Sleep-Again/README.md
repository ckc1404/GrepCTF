# Infinite Sleep (Level II)
> quasar-nova | 2023

# Description
I found a weird way to compile a python program into a binary and made it to sleep for minimum 2 days 
(using the libc sleep function) repeatedly. After that, I made the program to print the flag variable. 
Now, it is your task to figure out how can you leak the flag within the challenge time.

# Requirements 
+ Python 3.9
+ Docker (if needed)

# Hints 
(Same as Level I)
